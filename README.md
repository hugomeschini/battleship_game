### Battleship Game

##### This was my first project when doing my Data Science bootcamp at The Bridge (Madrid, Spain).

The project consists in creating a battleship game to be played against the computer.

Basically, you can check in the jupyter notebook the complete code, where is possible to make some tests playing against the machine.

You also can get my code and encapsulate all the functions in a ".py", anyway you can make a test trying to play with the whole code (I am sure it is working haha).

The main challenge in this project was to think about the logic to be used through the code.

Thanks so much!
